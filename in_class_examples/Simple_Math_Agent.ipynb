        "  - LangChain agents are designed to mimic intelligent entities that perceive their environment, make decisions to achieve specific goals, and learn over time. These agents primarily use Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason and determine the best approaches to fulfill user requests.\n",
        "  \n",
        "**Functionality and Tools:**\n",
        "  - To interact with and operate within their environment, LangChain agents use a set of tools called \"Tools.\" These tools are essentially methods or classes that allow the agent to perform actions like querying a database, updating a calendar event, or interacting with a stock market index through an API.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Toolkits:**\n",
        "  - A Toolkit in LangChain is a collection of various Tools that an agent can access to execute tasks. These toolkits are structured as arrays containing the tools available for the agent's use, facilitating the agent's interaction with its environment and task execution."
